      <h3 className="text1">Our wedding will take place at beautiful Lake Louisa State Park. Since accommodations fill up
        far in advance, we have already rented 16 lakeside cabins for Friday and Saturday night to
        ensure that guests who want to spend more time with us and party the night away under the
        stars, can do so without a care.
        We are hosting an informal welcome dinner by the campfire on Friday evening for those guests
        staying in the cabins, with Venezuelan-Brasilian style hotdogs, sâ€™mores and live music around
        the fire. We hope to unwind and spend time with all our favorite people together before the
        big day and give you the chance to explore all the beautiful trails, fishing, swimming, and
        kayaking that Lake Louisa has to offer!
